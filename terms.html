        <p>Brolled is a mobile application designed to users select from existing videos and add chat conversations in their own scenarios, these chat conversations are automatically dubbed by the application and the resulting video is exported. The Service includes features accessible through a freemium model, with additional premium features available via subscription.</p>

        <h2>3. Subscriptions and Free Trials</h2>
        <p><strong>Subscription Plans:</strong> Brolled offers premium features through monthly and annual subscription plans ("Subscription"). Details of the current subscription plans and their pricing are available within the Application.</p>
        <p><strong>Free Trial:</strong> Each subscription plan (both monthly and annual) includes a 7-day free trial period. During the free trial, you will have access to all premium features.</p>
        <p><strong>Payment:</strong> If you choose to subscribe after the free trial, or if you do not cancel your trial before it ends, your payment will be charged to your Apple App Store account (or the respective app store account used for the purchase) at confirmation of purchase.</p>
