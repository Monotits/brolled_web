        <h1>Privacy Policy for Brolled</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: 23.05.2025</p>

        <p>Welcome to Brolled! This Privacy Policy explains how Buğra Günay ("Owner", "we", "us", or "our") handles information in connection with your use of the Brolled mobile application (the "Application" or "Service").</p>
        <p>Your privacy is important to us. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
        <p>Brolled is designed with your privacy in mind. We do not collect, store, or process any personal data from you directly through the Application.</p>
        <p>This means:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We do not track your activity within the app.</li>
            <li>We do not collect your name, email address, location, device identifiers (other than what is necessary for the app store to process purchases), or any other personally identifiable information.</li>
            <li>We do not have access to the content (videos, text) you create within the Application unless you explicitly choose to share it with us for support purposes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Information Collected by Third Parties (RevenueCat)</h2>
        <p>To manage in-app purchases and subscriptions (including monthly and annual plans with a 7-day free trial), Brolled uses a third-party service called RevenueCat.</p>
        <p>RevenueCat may collect and process certain data necessary for processing payments and managing subscriptions. This data is handled according to RevenueCat's own Privacy Policy and Terms of Service. We encourage you to review RevenueCat's policies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>RevenueCat Privacy Policy: <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy/" target="_blank">https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy/</a></li>
            <li>RevenueCat Terms of Service: <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/terms/" target="_blank">https://www.revenuecat.com/terms/</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The information RevenueCat may handle includes anonymous purchase data, subscription status, and transaction identifiers. We do not receive or store your payment card details; these are handled securely by the Apple App Store (or the respective app store).</p>

        <h2>3. How We Use Information (Non-Personal)</h2>
        <p>Since we do not collect personal data, our use of any non-personal, aggregated, or anonymized data (if any were to be collected, for example, through app store analytics which are separate from the app's direct data collection) would be limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Improving the Application and its features.</li>
            <li>Understanding usage trends to enhance user experience.</li>
            <li>Troubleshooting technical issues.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
        <p>While we do not collect personal data within the Application itself, we are committed to ensuring that any interactions with third-party services like RevenueCat are handled securely to the extent of their capabilities and policies.</p>

        <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Brolled is not directed to children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age of consent in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware that a child has provided us with personal information without parental consent, we will take steps to remove such information. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child, please contact us at brolledapp@gmail.com.</p>

        <h2>6. Your Choices</h2>
        <p>Since we do not collect personal data, there are no specific "opt-out" choices related to data collection within the Brolled app itself. You can manage your in-app subscriptions through your Apple App Store (or respective app store) account settings.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the Application or on our website (brolled.com). You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted.</p>

        <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or our privacy practices, please contact us at:</p>
